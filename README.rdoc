= HOSTJOUR

http://github.com/bjeanes/hostjour

== DESCRIPTION:

This is an idea I am playing around with for RailsCamp 08 to help sharing Rails apps over bonjour on a local network. Unlike appjour, this will avoid having to use different ports and having a separate mongrel instance up for each of your apps. This setup is ideal for developers using Passenger in the development environment (like me)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Advertise all local host names setup using ghost (http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost) over the network with your primary interface IP

== SYNOPSIS:

  TODO

== REQUIREMENTS:

* dnssd
* ghost

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install dnssd ghost hostjour
